# Employee Location Tracker

## Overview
Employee Location Tracker is a React Native application designed to help the company to track the location of their employees, enabling them to determine whether employees are at the office or working remotely. This project has been developed by a team of 6 students as part of our collaboration with the company.

In the future, we plan to add APIs to further enhance the functionality of the app.
